Most people with Schizophrenia hear voices and have hallucinations of things that other people cannot see. People call them "stuck in their head" but that is not the case at all. Its a disorder where the person experiencing it can also have panic attacks and most people who experience Schizophrenia tend to develop depression and suicidal thoughts. Some people with Schizophrenia do commit suicide because of the severity of their condition and it is too hard for then to cope with the voices or the hallucinations. There are many behavioral aspects of Schizophrenia as they tend to socially isolate themselves because they do not want to add to the voices in their head. They also have cognitive, mood, psychology related disorders. They can also have a lot of trouble with speech and living a noraml life. If you have things like Schizophrenia you have to be medically tested to be able to drive and do certian things so they would not get triggered.    </p>

                    <h1>Behavioral</h1>
                    <p>People with Schizophrenia have a lot of behavioral issues as they have trouble balancing their mental problems with their everday physical life. They tend to socially isolate themselves so that no one can confront them or trigger them, as Schizophrenics can get triggered easily and have impulses. They can also have disorganized behavior, such as feeling many things at the same time. They can also have aggression, agitation, and compulsive behavior as they all correlate in some way. Schizophrenics can also get triggered by things like loud voices. They can also show a fair amount of hostility and repetitive movements like fidgeting and moving their feet. They also can have things like a lack of self restraint, which correlates with compulsive behavior. They can also slef harm due to suicidal thoughts or the voices in their head told them to, which is actually fairly common amound Schizophrenics.</p>
