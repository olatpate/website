                    Schizophrenia is a long term mental disorder that causes mental breakdowns and correlation between thinking and emotion, as Schizophrenics tend to see things that others don't. A typical Schizophrenic would have mental breakdowns beacause of the things that they "see". Certian Schizophrenics can see people and hear sounds that other ordinary person could not hear or see. Some Schizophrenics are known to have imaginary friends and they even talk to people who are in their mind. People often mistake Psychosis for Schizophrenia because they both are connected to a disconnection of reality. Psychosis, also known as Psychosis Disorder is a complete disconnection of reality, due to this the person is not aware of their behavior. Schizophrenia can occur with things like "invisible" people and voices in their head. Psychosis can also be a side affect of Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder. But they are not always directly correlated. Schizophrenia can be developed in adolencents but usually don't show signs until they are about 20.
